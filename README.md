# Brief Intro

A logic-based puzzle game that makes the players hate the game. Lack of proper instructions and out of the box logics make the game hateable.

# Introduction
**We Hate This Game** is a logic-based puzzle game. Game is hated because of its bugs and developers' laziness disguised as features. The annoyance includes-

### Complicated gameplay rules

### Getting stuck in a limbo

### Unreal collision detection

### Deterministic randomness
(You need to play the game to see how it is deterministic)

And many more (including not having the ability to restart a level)...


# Level Hints
The game has 7 levels from 0 to 8 skipping level 1 and level 2. The initially planned Level 1 and 2 were not made. It was possible to rename levels but the developers didn't feel like it.

Even though the gameplay instructions are unclear and game logics may change level to level, we expect the users to figure those out themselves. However, here goes solution hints in case you might need them.
